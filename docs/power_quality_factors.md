# Power Quality Cost Savings Parameters

When evaluating power quality cost savings for a solar PV system with Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), the following parameters are critical to monitor and assess:

1. **Voltage Stability**

- **Parameter:** Voltage fluctuations and deviations from nominal voltage.
- **Impact:** Poor voltage regulation can lead to equipment damage or reduced lifespan.
- **Savings:** Improved voltage stability reduces maintenance costs and improves operational efficiency.

2. **Frequency Stability**

- **Parameter:** Frequency variations from the nominal value (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz).
- **Impact:** Equipment and grid malfunctions due to frequency fluctuations.
- **Savings:** Mitigating frequency disturbances can lower repair and downtime costs.

3. **Harmonic Distortion**

- **Parameter:** Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in voltage and current.
- **Impact:** Harmonics can lead to overheating of equipment, increased losses, and interference with sensitive devices.
- **Savings:** Reducing harmonics decreases equipment overheating and failure rates.

4. **Reactive Power Management**

- **Parameter:** Power factor (ratio of real power to apparent power).
- **Impact:** Poor power factor leads to higher electricity bills due to penalties and reduced system efficiency.
- **Savings:** Improved power factor minimizes penalties and energy losses.

5. **Voltage and Current Imbalances**

- **Parameter:** Asymmetry in three-phase voltage or current.
- **Impact:** Imbalances can lead to inefficient motor operations and overheating of equipment.
- **Savings:** Balanced operations reduce wear on motors and transformers, extending their lifespan.

6. **Transient Response**

- **Parameter:** Ability to handle voltage sags, swells, and surges.
- **Impact:** Transients can damage equipment and disrupt operations.
- **Savings:** BESS smoothens transients, reducing equipment damage and operational interruptions.

7. **Load Matching**

- **Parameter:** Real-time matching of generation to load demand using BESS.
- **Impact:** Overloading or underutilization increases operational costs.
- **Savings:** Efficient load matching optimizes energy usage, reducing waste and costs.

8. **Peak Shaving**

- **Parameter:** Reduction of peak demand using stored energy in BESS.
- **Impact:** High demand peaks attract higher electricity tariffs.
- **Savings:** Peak shaving minimizes demand charges on electricity bills.

9. **Backup Power Availability**

- **Parameter:** Duration and capacity of power supplied during outages.
- **Impact:** Downtime can cause significant productivity and revenue losses.
- **Savings:** Reliable backup power prevents outage-related costs.

10. **Efficiency Gains**

- **Parameter:** System losses (inverters, storage, transformers).
- **Impact:** High losses increase operational costs.
- **Savings:** High-efficiency components reduce energy losses, leading to cost savings.

11. **Maintenance Costs**

- **Parameter:** Frequency and cost of maintaining equipment.
- **Impact:** Poor power quality increases wear and tear.
- **Savings:** Reducing wear through better power quality lowers maintenance costs.

12. **Energy Savings Through Demand Response**

- **Parameter:** Ability to reduce or shift load during high-cost periods.
- **Impact:** Higher energy costs during peak times.
- **Savings:** Participating in demand response programs reduces energy costs and may offer incentives.

13. **Grid Compliance**

- **Parameter:** Adherence to grid codes (e.g., harmonic limits, voltage ranges, power factor).
- **Impact:** Non-compliance may lead to fines or disconnection.
- **Savings:** Compliance reduces the risk of penalties and ensures operational continuity.
